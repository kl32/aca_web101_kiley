                <p>Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. All those little son of a guns. You are only limited by your imagination.</p>

                    <p>Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. All kinds of happy little splashes. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Just let these leaves jump off the brush I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.</p>
                        
                    <p>You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. A happy cloud. There comes a nice little fluffer.</p>
                        
                    <p>Let's get wild today. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.</p>
                        
                    <p>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Use your imagination, let it go.</p>
